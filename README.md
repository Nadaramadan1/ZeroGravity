# 🌌 ZeroGravity

*ZeroGravity* is an interactive, cosmic-themed web experience that helps users explore their mood and discover their current “vibe” through a playful, antigravity-inspired interface.

The project blends Vibe Coding, AI-inspired mood detection, and immersive UI design to create an emotional, lightweight, and engaging digital experience.

## 🚀 Concept
ZeroGravity is built around a simple idea:

> Your mood is constantly shifting — what if choosing your next vibe felt like floating through space?

Instead of traditional forms or dashboards, the user interacts with:
- A mood input
- A calm-to-chaos slider
- A “Let the Vibe Decide” action  

The result is a smooth, atmospheric experience that feels more like a journey than an app.
